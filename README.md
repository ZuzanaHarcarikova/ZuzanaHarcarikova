## Hi there 👋 I'm Zuzana!
I'm a data enthusiast with a background in audit and financial analysis.
Currently pivoting into data analytics, focusing on:

SQL (querying, transformations, reporting)
Power BI (interactive dashboards, DAX, data modeling)
Python (pandas, data cleaning, exploratory analysis)
💡 I enjoy working with data to extract insights, automate manual reporting, and solve real-world problems.

🛠️ On this profile, you’ll find:

Projects showcasing my SQL and Power BI skills
End-to-end data workflows (from raw data to dashboard)
Exploratory analysis in Python
📚 I have an academic SQL background and hands-on experience analyzing databases during my time as an auditor.

📍 Currently open to junior data analyst roles.
